# Politiek Gesprek - Testing Checklist

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Verify Database
```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'politiek_gesprek%';

-- Should return:
-- politiek_gesprek_sessions
-- politiek_gesprek_results
-- politiek_gesprek_rate_limit

-- Check if stemwijzer tables exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stemwijzer_questions WHERE is_active = 1;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stemwijzer_parties WHERE is_active = 1;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stemwijzer_positions;
```

### 2. Verify API Configuration
```bash
# Check if OpenAI API key is set
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Or test via PHP
php -r "echo getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') ? 'API key found' : 'API key NOT found';"
```

### 3. Check File Permissions
```bash
# Ensure files are readable
ls -la ajax/politiek-gesprek.php
ls -la controllers/politiek-gesprek.php
ls -la views/politiek-gesprek.php
ls -la includes/ChatGPTAPI.php
```
